# viola_jones
This repository includes all the python files with different versions of implementation of the viola-jones paper for facial recognition. 
vj2_2.py is the final training code that implements the algorithm. it outputs a file with the cascade specification.
vj_4 is used to run the final results.

The locations given are complete urls from my personal computer and as such wont work. Also the images used wern't uploaded.

This is very messy as it is from before I started to use git.
